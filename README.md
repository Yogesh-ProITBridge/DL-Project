# Computer vision-Project

Problem Statement : 

This dataset was downloaded from the NEU Metal Surface Defects Database, which collects four kinds of
typical surface defects of metal strips: Crack, Pinhole, undercut, shrinkage. 
The database includes 1040 images and 199 samples, each of four typical surface defects.

I'm Using YOLO V5 from Ultraytics

I also attached my .ipynb file (Metal_Detection)
Training weights file - best.pt

Steps :
- Data Agumentation
- Data Annotation
- Split the labels and images into train and validation
- Choose the model to train
- Testing the model
